      <p>The Process</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to "The Process" section of my website, where I unveil the
        intricate steps behind the creation of my artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        To commence, each piece begins with the careful preparation of the wood.
        I meticulously sand and finish pre-cut pine, ensuring a smooth and
        pristine canvas for my creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this, I embark on the framework, measuring and outlining the
        design's structure. However, the beauty lies in the spontaneity; at this
        stage, the final outcome remains a mystery, as I let intuition guide the
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the groundwork is laid, I delve into the realm of color, allowing
        the process to organically unfold. Using a blend of acrylic and pouring
        medium, I mix the paint to achieve the perfect texture for the
        subsequent dotting technique. This method serves as a soothing ritual,
        where my mind effortlessly calculates and counts, fostering a sense of
        tranquility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersed in the creative zone, I infuse each piece with intention,
        breathing love, peace, and whatever emotions arise within me into the
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey continues with the application of epoxy, conducted at my
        dedicated station. Here, I pour, flame polish, and meticulously wipe the
        surface, dedicating hours to ensure a flawless finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a meticulous 24-hour drying period, I proceed to refine the
        piece, sanding the finish with 400 grit sandpaper. This process is
        repeated, layering upon layer, until the desired depth and sheen are
        achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, after the careful culmination of each step, the artwork is
        ready to grace your space as a tabletop or wall hanging, inviting you to
        immerse yourself in its beauty and craftsmanship.
